# FLat UI Theme for Emacs

Inspired by the color scheme provided at http://flatuicolors.com. This
theme is for GNU Emacs version 24+, in which theming is officially
supported.

Both light and dark style are included.

Note: Nyan cat not included :-p

## Installation

Copy the `FlatUI-*theme.el` files to somewhere in your Emacs
`custom-theme-load-path`. Then either `M-x load-theme<RET>FlatUI` or
`(load-theme 'FlatUI t)`. Use `FlatUI-Dark` for the dark style.

Additionally, you can also install `FlatUI-theme-utils.el`. It has a
function to load either theme by specifying `'light` or `'dark`, and a
function to switch between the two.
